Welcome to the CS Hackathon 2025 Web Development Workshop! This workshop is designed to introduce participants to the fundamentals of web development and provide practical tools you will be able to use during the hackathon.

This repository contains the code and resources used in the workshop. It is divided into several stages we will go through during the workshop, each stage is available in a separate branch.

---

### Stage 1 - Initializing the Project

This stage already contains the initial setup of the project. It includes all necessary boilerplate for working with React and TypeScript. This project was initialized using the following command (**No need to run this command yourself**):

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react-ts
```

Before you run this project, you need to install it's dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

In order to run the project, use the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server of the project. You can view the application at `http://localhost:5173/`.

### Stage 2 - Pokemon Fun Facts

In this stage, we have replaced the template website with a simple application that displays fun facts about Pokemon. The application fetches it's data from [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/).

Your task in this stage you will integrate with PokeAPI, and render the Pokemon, image and the pokemon fact.

----

### Stage 3 - Live coding

In this stage, we are going to integrate with LLMs - and generate some Pokemon-fake-news. In additon, we will add some basic game functionality - basic logic to choose if the fact is true or false.

### Your turn!

| Feature                    | Example LLM Prompt                                                                                   | Tip                                                            |
|:---------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Two-Player Offline Mode    | “Generate a React hook and component that alternates turns between Player 1 and Player 2 on the same device.” | Use a `currentPlayer` state and toggle it after each guess.     |
| Turn Limit                 | “Create a configurable turn-counter component in React that decrements from X and shows remaining turns.” | Pass `maxTurns` as a prop and disable inputs when it hits 0.    |
| Time-Based Scoring         | “Write a function to record time taken for each guess and compute `score = maxTime – elapsedSeconds`.”   | Capture `startTime` on question render and `endTime` on answer. |
| Level System               | “Show how to adjust OpenAI API parameters (e.g. temperature) based on selected difficulty level.”       | Map levels ↔ temperature (e.g. easy 0.3, hard 0.8).             |
| Category Modes             | “Generate code to switch between different news-site endpoints and fetch facts per category.”          | Centralize API URLs in a config object and select by category. |
